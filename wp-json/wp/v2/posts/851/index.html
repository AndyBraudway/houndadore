The Kennel Club expects breeders to conduct thorough health screenings to identify any potential issues.

Regular exercise not only helps maintain a healthy weight but also stimulates the dog&#8217;s mind and prevents behavioral issues that can arise from pent-up energy.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Kennel Club recognizes the importance of a balanced diet for the Houndadore breed.
