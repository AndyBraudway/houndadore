These dogs, known as St. John&#8217;s Water Dogs, were excellent swimmers and had a natural affinity for retrieving objects from the water. They were highly valued for their ability to retrieve fishing nets, haul ropes, and even rescue drowning victims.<\/p>\n<p>The St. John&#8217;s Water Dogs were a diverse breed, with various coat colors and sizes.
