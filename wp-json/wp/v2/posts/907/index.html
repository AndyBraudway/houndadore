These dogs have a lot of energy and require regular exercise to stay happy and healthy. In rural areas, there may be limited opportunities for off-leash exercise, which can be a challenge for Houndadores. However, there are several solutions to this challenge. Owners can create a secure and spacious outdoor area for their Houndadores to run and play.
