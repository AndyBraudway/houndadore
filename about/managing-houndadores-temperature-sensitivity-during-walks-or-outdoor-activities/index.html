<p>Similarly, during winter months, be cautious of icy or snowy surfaces. These can be slippery and pose a risk of injury to your dog. Consider using booties or paw wax to provide traction and protect their paws from the cold and ice. Additionally, wipe their paws after the walk to remove any salt or chemicals that may have been used to melt ice, as these can be harmful if ingested.</p>
<p>Lastly, always pay attention to your Houndadore&#8217;s behavior during walks. They may not be able to communicate their discomfort directly, so it is crucial to observe any signs of distress. If your dog appears excessively panting, lethargic, or is struggling to keep up, it may be a sign that they are too hot or cold. In such cases, find a shaded area or a warm spot to rest and allow them to recover before continuing the walk.</p>
